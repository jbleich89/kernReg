\title{Run a logistic regression using Kernel PCA}
\usage{
kpclr(kpca_object, y, num_pcs = NULL, frac_var = NULL, weights = NULL,
  family = "binomial")
}
\arguments{
\item{kpca_object}{The object that contains the kernel and the kernelized data with its eigendecomposition}

\item{y}{The response to be regressed on the features which are the principal components of the kernelized data}

\item{num_pcs}{The number of principal components to use for the regression (this or \code{frac_var} must be specified)}

\item{frac_var}{Pick the number of principal components to use based on the fraction of variance to explain (this or \code{num_pcs} must be specified)}

\item{weights}{Weights to be used on each observation in a weighted generalized least squares implementation. If not specified (default), uniform weights are used}

\item{family}{The family parameter to be passed to the glm function. Default is "binomial." Note that with this default, AIC calculations are not possible.}
}
\value{
An lm object with the kpca_object embedded as well as the number of principal components used
}
\description{
\code{kpclr} runs a logistic regression on features created from an eigendecomposition
of a certain dimension of the kernelized data
